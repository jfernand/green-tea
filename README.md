# green-tea

[![CI](https://github.com/jfernand/green-tea/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jfernand/green-tea/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Green threads (user-space cooperative tasks) in Rust, built from scratch to learn how
context switching works on x86_64, aarch64 and riscv64.

Write-up: [Multitasking](https://jotafernand.casaroja.es/posts/019-multitasking/)

Inspired by https://dzania.github.io/green-threads-from-scratch/

With minimal help from R. Claude and R. Junie

## Layout

The workspace has two versions side by side, so you can compare them:

| crate | what it shows |
|---|---|
| [`green-tea-v1`](green-tea-v1) | The first working version, x86_64 only. One global `MAIN` context, `static mut` state, and a `VecDeque` `run()` scheduler. Its git history goes through the bugs: a shadowed `static`, a missing `done` flag, and a stack misaligned for the SysV ABI. |
| [`green-tea-v2`](green-tea-v2) | The same ideas split into layers: `arch` (save/restore registers, prime a stack) → `Task` (an asymmetric coroutine that switches back to whoever resumed it) → `run`/`spawn` (a round-robin scheduler on a thread-local run queue). No `static mut`. Runs on x86_64, aarch64 (including Apple Silicon) and riscv64. |
| [`xtask`](xtask) | `cargo xtask test`: runs v2 across targets under qemu. |

Each version has two demos: `coop-2-*` drives two tasks with a hand-written loop, and
`coop-n-*` uses the scheduler.

```sh
cargo run --bin coop-n-v2
```

## How a context switch works

`swap_context(from, to)` stores the stack pointer and the callee-saved registers into
`from`, loads `to`'s, and returns, but onto `to`'s stack. To the compiler it is an
ordinary function call, so the caller-saved registers have already been spilled.

A new task's context is primed so that the first switch "returns" into a small
trampoline, `bootstrap_entry`, which calls the task's entry function.

| | x86_64 | aarch64 | riscv64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Return address | pushed on the stack by `call` | `x30` (link register) | `ra` |
| Callee-saved integer registers | `rbx rbp r12–r15` | `x19–x28`, `x29` (fp) | `s0–s11` |
| Callee-saved float registers | none | `d8–d15` | `fs0–fs11` |
| Stack alignment | 16 bytes before a `call` | 16 bytes, always | 16 bytes |

The assembly is in [`green-tea-v2/src/arch`](green-tea-v2/src/arch).

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace   # host (v1 needs x86_64)
cargo xtask test         # v2 on host, aarch64 and riscv64 (qemu), debug and release
```

`cargo xtask test` needs qemu's user-mode emulator and the cross linkers. On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install qemu-user gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu libc6-dev-arm64-cross \
                 gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu libc6-dev-riscv64-cross
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu aarch64-apple-darwin
```

CI runs the same matrix, plus the v2 tests natively on an Apple Silicon runner.
